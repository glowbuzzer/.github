The glowbuzzer toolkit allows you to build complex machine control applications with React & node.js.

To get started with the toolkit, the best place to start is the [Get started - no hardware](https://www.glowbuzzer.com/get-started/simulation) guide on our website.

If you want to dive into the code then look at the following repositories:

1. **gbr** for the React components
1. **gbem** for how we interact with industrial fieldbusses
1. **gbsm** for how we interact with motor drives ICs
